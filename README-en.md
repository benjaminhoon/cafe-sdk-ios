### 3. Initialize the PLUG SDK

Initializing the PLUG SDK will vary depending on the supported language.

#### 3.1 Support for Korean only (NAVER Cafe)

Configure the initialization information below to initialize the PLUG SDK that supports Korean only.

- Client ID (ClientId) and client secret (ClientSecret) you received after registering your application in [NAVER Login Developers](https://developers.naver.com/apps/#/register?api=nvlogin)
- Cafe ID you received after creating your Cafe in [NAVER Cafe](http://section.cafe.naver.com/)
- [URL Scheme](https://developers.naver.com/apps/#/myapps) you entered after registering your application in [NAVER Login Developers](https://developers.naver.com/apps/#/register?api=nvlogin)
- Parent view controller where PLUG is loaded
- Channel code (set this value to "KOREAN" if only Korean channel is used)

```objective-c
    [[NCSDKManager getSharedInstance] setNaverLoginClientId:@"197CymaStozo7X5r2qR5"
                                     naverLoginClientSecret:@"evCgKH1kJL"
                                                     cafeId:28290504];
                                                     
    [[NCSDKLoginManager getSharedInstance] setNaverLoginURLScheme:@"gLinkSample"];
    
    [[NCSDKManager getSharedInstance] setParentViewController:self];
    
    [[NCSDKManager getSharedInstance] setChannelCode:KOREAN];
```

#### 3.2 Support for languages other than Korean

Configure the initialization information below to initialize the PLUG SDK that supports languages other than Korean.

- Consumer key you received after creating your community
- Community ID you received after creating your community
- Parent view controller where PLUG is loaded

```objective-c
    [[NCSDKManager getSharedInstance] setNeoIdConsumerKey:@"IHCd_HmSiMcXOMC37xZ8"
                                              communityId:1013329];
                                              
    [[NCSDKManager getSharedInstance] setParentViewController:self];
```

> **How to check your community ID and consumer key**  
> Visit http://g.cafe.naver.com/plugsample/manage/consumer and log in to your community using the account with manager privileges.  
> You can find the information in **Settings > Communities > In-App Community Settings** as shown in the image below.

#### 4.1 presentMainViewController: method

The presentMainViewController: method starts the PLUG SDK. The code below shows how to implement the presentMainViewController: method.

```objective-c
[[NCSDKManager getSharedInstance] presentMainViewController];

```

> **NCSDKManager class**  
> The NCSDKManager class controls the PLUG SDK. For more information about features which the NCSDKManager class can control, see "[FEATURE LIST](https://plug.gitbooks.io/plug-sdk-ios/content/en/index.html)".
